*List of exercises and projects and how to run them-

1) Exercise 4
- Just run the code in the Processing application and press the alphabet keys on the keyboard to fill the screen.

2) Exercise 5
- Run the HTML file and allow microphone use on which ever browser you open the file in. Next, run the code file in the Processing application and and say anything in the microphone to output it in the console. (You can say 'Hello' and it would guide you through a small conversation)

3) Project 3
- Just run the code for you to see the custom pixel transformation of the picture in the 'data' folder inside the project folder.

4) Exercise 6
- For this you would require a camera on your Laptop or PC in order to test it out. Without a live camera this application won't be able to be tested. Once, a camera is setup you can just run the application and test it.

5) Exercise 7
- This needs to be run without any additional information and check the iterative patters on the screen.

6) Exercise 8

7) Project 4
- This is using a music file present in the 'data' folder inside the project folder. This music file is using the visual interpretation of the beats. We can use the right and left arrow keys to increase or decrease the volume and up and down arrow keys to change the smoothness of the visual effect.
